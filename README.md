# Shilling Attacks against Recommender Systems

This repository contains our implementations for Shilling Attacks against Recommender Systems. 

Folder structure:
- `AUSH`: The implementation of AUSH used in our CIKM'20 paper.
- `Leg-UP`: The implementation of Leg-UP and a unified framework for comparing Leg-UP with various attackers including AIA, DCGAN, WGAN, Random Attack, Average Attack, Segment Attack and Bandwagon Attack.
- `Data`: Recommendation datasets used in our experiments.

See `README.md` in each folder for more details.
